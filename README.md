## Can the genre of a song be predicted based off of a few audio features? What if more artist-based features are included?

## Can a song be identified as hot or not off of the same set of variables?

Using a 10,000 song sample, from the Million Song Dataset (https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/), these questions will attempt to be answered.

This dataset contains a million songs from 1922-2011, with artist tagged information from Echonest (now part of Spotify), along with audio measurements, and other relevant information.
